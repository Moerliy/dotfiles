#+title: Dotfile Config
#+AUTHOR: Moritz Gleissner
#+DESCRIPTION: This is a description for my dotfiles


* Forword
Welcome to my dotfiles repository. All of the dotfiles and its installation will include [[./.config/hypr/README.org][Hyprland]] as desktop environment and a setup of [[./.config/doom/config.org][Doom Emacs]].

I use Arch on an M1 mac btw ðŸ˜‰ so you should have a good look at the required packages and maybe substitute some of them for there better counterpart, but as far as I'm convinced all of the packages that are being used, none of them isn't capable of running on x86_64 architecture.
